# Java Basic CRUD Project
## Ciao, Hey there!

This is an unconventional educational project of my own that mixes two subjects: Java and Italian.

I am currently learning both, so I thought mixing them would be a good idea. 

## Oh yes, what can you do with this?

You can create - with the help of a MySQL database - a simple app for companies and employee management, running 100% locally and private (offline).

The project contains graphical interfaces to make the UX as good as possible.
